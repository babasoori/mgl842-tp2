# Contributing to PR Reviewer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PR Reviewer! This document provides a guideline for contributing to the  
project. By following these guidelines, you help to create a collaborative and secure environment where everyone can  
contribute effectively.

## Community and Discussions

- **Join the Community**: Before starting, join our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/jDE7DDHC) to become part  
of our community.
- **Discussions**: Use the server to discuss ideas, enhancements, and any issues you want to work on. This is a great  
place to get support and collaborate with others.

## Contribution Process

1. **Identify an Issue or Idea**: Begin by finding an issue to work on or by proposing a new feature or improvement.  
Check if it already exists to avoid duplication.
2. **Create an Issue**: If it’s a new idea or problem you’ve identified, open a new issue in the GitHub repository.
3. **Develop Your Contribution**: Write code in your local environment. Ensure you are following our coding standards  
and practices.
4. **Write Unit Tests**: It’s important that all code contributions come with unit tests. This ensures the reliability  
and quality of the software.
5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Once you have tested your changes, submit a PR. Link the issue your PR resolves.
6. **Code Review**: Your PR will be reviewed by maintainers. Participate in the discussion to answer questions and  
make any necessary changes.
7. **Merge**: After approval, your PR will be merged into the main codebase.

## Security Contributions

- If you discover a security issue, **do not open an issue or PR**. Instead, send an email directly to  
ai.bot@remediations.io with the relevant information.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title and Categorization**: Begin your PR title with a clear and descriptive message. Include the CATEGORY at the  
start of your title. Categories are typically one of `security`, `change`, `feature`, `improvement`, or `bug`. Most  
contributions will fall under `bug` or `improvement`. If you’re uncertain about the right category, choose the one  
that seems the most appropriate; our maintainers will assist you if any adjustments are needed.  
- **Description**: Provide a detailed description of what your PR aims to resolve or improve. This helps reviewers  
understand the context and the impact of your changes.
- **Issue Reference**: Link back to any related issues or discussion threads. This helps to track the progress and  
rationale behind the contribution.
- **Code Standards**: Make sure your contribution adheres to our coding standards and practices. We strive for high  
quality and consistency in our codebase.
- **Testing**: Ensure all unit tests are written for new code and that all tests pass before submitting your PR for   
review. This is crucial for maintaining the reliability and quality of the application.

We appreciate the time you invest in contributing and encourage open communication throughout the process. Thank you  
for enhancing PR Reviewer and for your commitment to its quality and security!
